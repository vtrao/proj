# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Repository

This directory contains all Root Cause Analysis documents following the "Working Backwards" 5-Why methodology.

## 🎯 **RCA Creation Guidelines**

### **Mandatory Requirements**
- **Location**: ALL RCA documents MUST be created in this directory
- **Naming Convention**: `RCA_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_IncidentDescription.md`
- **Format**: Follow "Working Backwards" 5-Why RCA methodology
- **Review**: All RCAs require management review and approval

### **Document Structure Requirements**
Each RCA document must include these sections:

1. **📋 Incident Overview** 
   - Incident ID, Date/Time, Severity
   - Duration, Service Impact, MTTR
   - Problem Statement

2. **⏱️ Timeline**
   - Chronological sequence of events
   - Detection time, escalation path
   - Key decision points

3. **🔍 5-Why Analysis**
   - Systematic root cause investigation
   - Contributing factors analysis
   - Immediate, systemic, and root causes

4. **📋 Corrective Action Plan**
   - Immediate corrective actions
   - Preventive measures
   - Implementation timeline

5. **🔄 Implementation Status**
   - Completed actions
   - Pending actions
   - Success metrics

6. **📚 Lessons Learned**
   - Key insights
   - Operational improvements
   - Process enhancements

## 🚨 **Incident Classification System**

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **SEV-1 CRITICAL** | System outage, data loss, security breach | Service down, data corruption |
| **SEV-2 HIGH** | Performance degradation, partial impact | Slow response, feature unavailable |
| **SEV-3 MEDIUM** | Minor issues, workaround available | Non-critical bug, documentation gap |
| **SEV-4 LOW** | Cosmetic issues, documentation updates | UI inconsistency, typo |

## 📁 **Current RCA Documents**

### **2025 Incidents**
- [`RCA_2025-01-19_CheetahRepositoryCorruption.md`](RCA_2025-01-19_CheetahRepositoryCorruption.md) - SEV-1: Repository corruption incident

## 🛠️ **RCA Process Workflow**

1. **Incident Detection** → Immediate response and containment
2. **RCA Creation** → Create document in this directory using template
3. **Investigation** → Conduct 5-Why analysis and timeline reconstruction
4. **Review Process** → Management and technical review
5. **Action Implementation** → Execute corrective and preventive measures
6. **Follow-up** → Track implementation and measure effectiveness

## 📋 **RCA Template Usage**

```bash
# Create new RCA document
touch copilot_agent_rca/RCA_2025-MM-DD_HHMM_IncidentDescription.md

# Follow the structure:
# - Use clear, objective language
# - Include specific timestamps
# - Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
# - Provide actionable recommendations
```

## 🔍 **Analysis Best Practices**

### **5-Why Methodology**
- Start with the observable problem
- Ask "why" for each answer until root cause reached
- Look for contributing factors at each level
- Distinguish between immediate, systemic, and root causes

### **Documentation Standards**
- Use factual, timeline-based narrative
- Include relevant screenshots, logs, metrics
- Reference related documentation and systems
- Quantify impact where possible

## 📊 **RCA Metrics & Tracking**

- **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)**: Target < 2 hours for SEV-1
- **RCA Completion**: Within 48 hours of incident resolution
- **Action Implementation**: 90% completion within 30 days
- **Incident Reduction**: Trend analysis for prevention effectiveness

## 🔄 **Continuous Improvement**

RCAs drive operational excellence through:
- **Process Improvements**: System and procedure enhancements
- **Training Updates**: Knowledge sharing and skill development  
- **Preventive Measures**: Proactive risk mitigation
- **Cultural Learning**: Blame-free analysis and improvement focus
