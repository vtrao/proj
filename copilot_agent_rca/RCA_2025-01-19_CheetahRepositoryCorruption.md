## üéØ **5-Why Root Cause Analysis** *(Working Backwards Methodology)*

### **Problem Statement**
Terraform state files were deleted and repository structure corrupted, nearly destroying the Cheetah infrastructure platform.

### **Why Level 1: Why were Terraform state files deleted?**
**Answer**: Agent executed destructive cleanup commands (`rm -f *.tf*`, `rm -rf infrastructure/cheetah`) without understanding the critical nature of these files.

### **Why Level 2: Why did the agent execute destructive commands without understanding file criticality?**
**Answer**: Agent operated under the assumption that "cleanup" meant removing all generated/temporary files, lacking specific knowledge about Terraform state file importance and infrastructure management principles.

### **Why Level 3: Why did the agent lack knowledge about infrastructure file criticality?**
**Answer**: No established operational procedures existed to identify and protect critical infrastructure files before automated operations. Agent had insufficient training on infrastructure-as-code principles and state management.

### **Why Level 4: Why were there no operational procedures to protect critical files?**
**Answer**: The system relied on implicit knowledge rather than explicit operational safeguards. No validation checkpoints existed before destructive operations, and there was an over-reliance on automated decision-making without human oversight for critical operations.

### **Why Level 5: Why was there over-reliance on automated decision-making for critical operations?**
**Answer**: **ROOT CAUSE** - Insufficient governance framework and operational maturity. The system lacked:
- Defined boundaries between automated vs. human-supervised operations  
- Risk classification for different types of operations
- Mandatory approval processes for destructive actions
- Infrastructure change management procedures
