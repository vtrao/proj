### 📋 Information to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### 🔍 Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive security scanning:

- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog, GitLeaks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety (Python), npm audit (JavaScript)
- **Code Analysis**: CodeQL, Bandit, ESLint
- **Container Scanning**: Anchore, Docker security best practices
- **Infrastructure**: AWS security best practices

### 🔐 Security Features

- **Environment Variables**: All secrets managed via environment variables
- **Container Security**: Non-root user, minimal base images
- **Network Security**: Kubernetes network policies, security contexts
- **Access Control**: AWS IAM roles with least privilege
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and metrics

### 📋 Compliance

This project follows security best practices including:

- **OWASP Top 10** vulnerability prevention
- **CIS Benchmarks** for container security
- **AWS Security Best Practices**
- **Kubernetes Security Standards**

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### 🌍 Environment Variables

Required security-related environment variables:

```bash
# Database (never hardcode)
DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL:-"default_local_value"}

# AWS Credentials (CI/CD only)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

# Application Security
SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY:-"dev-only-secret"}
CORS_ORIGINS=${CORS_ORIGINS:-"http://localhost:3000"}
```

### 🔒 Secrets Management

- **Local Development**: `.env` files (never committed)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Secrets
- **Production**: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
- **Kubernetes**: Native Secrets with encryption at rest

### 🛡️ Container Security

```dockerfile
# Security best practices in Dockerfile:
FROM python:3.11-slim  # Minimal base image
RUN adduser --disabled-password appuser  # Non-root user
USER appuser  # Run as non-root
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
```

### ☁️ Infrastructure Security

- **EKS Cluster**: Private endpoints, security groups
- **Network**: VPC with private subnets
- **IAM**: Least privilege access policies
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit

## 🚀 Incident Response

### 📞 Emergency Contacts

In case of security incident:

1. **Immediate**: Stop the affected service
2. **Assess**: Determine impact and scope
3. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Communicate**: Notify stakeholders
5. **Remediate**: Apply fixes and verify
6. **Learn**: Post-incident review

### 📊 Incident Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | System compromised, data breach | < 1 hour | RCE, data exposure |
| **High** | Service disruption possible | < 4 hours | Auth bypass, XSS |
| **Medium** | Limited impact | < 24 hours | Info disclosure |
| **Low** | Minimal impact | Next cycle | Minor config issues |
